#    Amazon S3 Storage Lens â€“ Organization-wide Visibility into Object Storage

## Introduction:

Amazon S3 Storage Lens provides a single view of object storage usage and activity across our entire Amazon S3 storage. It includes drilldown options to generate insights at the organization, account, Region, bucket, or even prefix level.
Amazon S3 Storage Lens aggregates our usage and activity metrics and displays the information in the account snapshot on the Amazon S3 console home (Buckets) page, interactive dashboards, or through a metrics export that we can download in CSV or Parquet format. We can use the dashboard to visualize insights and trends, flag outliers, and receive recommendations for optimizing storage costs and applying data protection best practices.
